# Tenzies Game App

## Description

This is the Tenzies Project from Scrimba, part of the [React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) with Bob Ziroll. The challenged included a design file from figma, and its main purpose was to get more comfortable working with React components, useState and useEffect.

However, I took it a step further and converting the game to use typescript, and utilizing the Tailwind CSS Framework.

Ability to hold dice for strategic rolls
Confetti celebration for winners!
