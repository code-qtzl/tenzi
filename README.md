# Tenzies Game App

## Description

This is the Tenzies Project from Scrimba, part of the [React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) with Bob Ziroll. The challenged included a design file from figma, and its main purpose was to get more comfortable working with React components, useState and useEffect.

However, I took it a step further and converting the game to use Typescript, and utilizing the Tailwind CSS Framework.

## Features

A fast-paced game that will challenge your strategic thinking and quick decision-making skills. Hold onto your dice for strategic rolls, but remember, the clock is ticking! The longer you hold onto your dice, the more you risk losing the race to be the quickest finisher.

## Tools Used

-   React
-   JavaScript
-   Typescript
-   Nano ID (for generating unique dice IDs)
-   React Confetti (for victory celebrations)
-   Tailwind CSS (for styling)

## Controls

Click on a die to hold/unhold it.
Click the "Roll" button to roll all unheld dice.
Click the "Start Game" button to begin a new game.
