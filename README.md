## Description

#### What is [Tenzies](https://ilovetenzi.com/the-tale-of-tenzi/)?

I enhanced the existing project from [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/home) by converting it to TypeScript and using Tailwind for styling.

## Tenzie Highlights

-   A fast-paced game that challenges your strategic thinking and quick decision-making.
-   Hold onto your dice for strategic rollsâ€”timing is everything!
-   The clock is ticking, so act fast to outpace your opponents.
-   The longer you hold your dice, the higher the risk of losing the race again

## Controls

-   Click on a die to hold/unhold it.
-   Click the "Roll" button to roll all unheld dice.
-   Click the "Start Game" button to begin a new game.
